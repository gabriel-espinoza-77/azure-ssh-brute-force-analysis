# Post-Incident Analysis: Azure SSH Brute-Force

This project documents a real-world post-incident analysis involving SSH brute-force attacks against virtual machines (VMs) within a Microsoft Azure tenant. The investigation was initiated following a Microsoft Security Notice and involved both manual threat hunting and the use of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's (MDE) built-in Incidents Dashboard.

The goal of this project is to showcase deep forensic investigation techniques, detection logic development, and an understanding of threat behavior patterns using Microsoft tools and threat intelligence sources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (Advanced Hunting)
- Microsoft Azure
- VirusTotal (static malware analysis)
- ChatGPT (supportive analysis and enrichment)
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## üéØ Objectives

- Trace the origin and spread of SSH brute-force attacks targeting internal Azure VMs
- Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), scripts, persistence mechanisms, and lateral movement attempts
- Demonstrate manual detection and enrichment techniques outside of automated alerting
- Map adversarial behavior to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for structured understanding
