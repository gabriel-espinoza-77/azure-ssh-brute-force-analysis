# MDE Dashboard Review

This file summarizes alerts, incidents, and automated detections surfaced by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) during the SSH brute-force campaign observed in March‚ÄìApril 2025.

The objective is to assess MDE‚Äôs automated coverage and correlate it with findings from manual threat hunting documented in `initial-threat-hunt.md`.

## Alert Storyline and Timeline of Detection

### February 17, 2025 ‚Äî First Suspicious Activity (Not Detected)

No MDE alert was generated during the earliest stages of compromise on `Linux-VulnMgmt-Kobe`, despite a large number of failed SSH sign-in attempts followed by a successful brute-force login from a Microsoft Azure IP. The system then executed scripts that disabled firewall protections and retrieved multiple malicious files from `194.32.145.243`.

> ‚ùó This stage was completely missed by MDE‚Äôs automated detection. Manual investigation documented these details in `initial-threat-hunt.md`.

---

### February 20, 2025 ‚Äî Lateral Movement Begins

Still without MDE alerts, malware on `Levi-Linux-Vulnerability` initiated peer-to-peer propagation using the FritzFrog (Multiverse) trojan family. Scripts named `retea`, `Update`, and `network` were executed, deploying mining payloads and persistence mechanisms. Files such as `diicot`, `kuak`, and `cache` were dropped.

> ‚ùó MDE failed to detect or surface alerts for this lateral movement or file ingress. Infection paths were only uncovered through KQL-based manual threat hunting.

### March 17, 2025 ‚Äî First Automated Detection

**Alert**: *Possible SSH brute-force attack*  
**Device**: sakel-lunix-2.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net  
**Timestamp**: March 17, 2025 @ 15:36 UTC  

**Summary**:  
MDE finally raised an alert for brute-force behavior after over **85,000** outbound SSH connection attempts were made using the `.bisis` executable. However, manual hunting had previously confirmed this behavior began on **March 14**, meaning this was a **delayed detection**.  

<p align="center"> <img src="<!-- Screenshot: SSH brute-force alert from MDE dashboard -->" alt="SSH brute-force alert in MDE" width="800"/> </p>

> üîÅ Correlates directly with findings in `initial-threat-hunt.md` under the section covering `.bisis` command behavior.

---

### March 18, 2025 ‚Äî Outbound C2 Alert

**Alert**: *Connection to known malicious domain*  
**Device**: jr-linux-vm-test.p2zfvso05mlezjev3ck4vqd3kd.cx.internal.cloudapp.net  
**Timestamp**: March 18, 2025 (Time unspecified)  

**Summary**:  
MDE flagged a connection to the domain `dinpasiune.com`, which had a VirusTotal score of 12/94. This domain was referenced in the `./retea` and `./network` scripts used to fetch additional payloads. The alert correctly identified the C2 beaconing attempt but did **not flag the scripts**, such as `retea`, or the downloaded file `cache`.

<p align="center"> <img src="<!-- Screenshot: C2 domain alert in MDE -->" alt="C2 alert in MDE" width="800"/> </p>

> üîÅ This aligns with the manual discovery of beaconing behavior using `curl` commands found in the Update script chain.

---

### March 18‚ÄìApril 3, 2025 ‚Äî Persistence and Propagation

No additional alerts were generated by MDE for:
- Execution of malicious files such as `UpzBUBnv`, `kuak`, or `diicot`
- Scheduled cron jobs for `.b` or `Update`
- SSH inbound connections from suspicious IPs (e.g., `65.49.1.121`, score: 9/94)

Devices including `linuxvmcraig` and `linux-vulnerability-test-dylan` continued to exhibit brute-force behavior and payload execution patterns similar to those previously documented, but **MDE surfaced no alerts for these hosts**.

> ‚ùó Indicates a lack of telemetry-based correlation across hosts despite reused scripts, file names, and infrastructure.

## Gaps and Observations

### üîç Strengths
- MDE successfully detected:
  - High-volume SSH brute-force activity once a threshold was reached (March 17 alert)
  - Connections to known malicious domains (e.g., `dinpasiune.com`)
- Correlation between network behavior and some known C2 infrastructure was effective.

### üö® Gaps
- **Delayed detection**: Brute-force attempts began March 14; MDE only triggered alerts on March 17.
- **Missed early-stage persistence**: Initial execution of `Update`, `.b`, and `History` was not flagged.
- **Limited visibility into lateral movement**: Even with similar behaviors across five VMs, MDE only surfaced alerts on two.
- **No behavioral alerting on ELF-based mining payloads**: Despite multiple VirusTotal-flagged binaries (e.g., `kuak` scored 31/64), no execution-level alerts were generated.
- **Script-based attacks flew under radar**: Custom cron jobs, obfuscated bash payloads, and curl-based exfiltration were not surfaced.

### üß≠ Manual Correlation Gained Visibility
The threat-hunting methodology outlined in `initial-threat-hunt.md` revealed:
- Early infection vectors  
- The full lifecycle of deployed payloads  
- Coordinated lateral movement  
- Reused persistence tactics across multiple hosts

> Without this, the majority of Diicot‚Äôs activity would have gone undetected by MDE alone.
