### Descriptions and Observations

- **`.b`**: A persistence script likely used to schedule or trigger other payloads (e.g., via cron). VirusTotal score is low but behavior is consistent with persistence.
- **`x`**: Auxiliary file invoked after `.bisis` runs SSH brute-force attempts. Score is low; file may evade detection due to minimal signature.
- **`.bisis`**: Core brute-force tool used to launch SSH attacks on internal and external IPs. Score is moderate and flagged as PUA.PortScan.
- **`Update`**: Central loader used repeatedly across compromised devices. Responsible for invoking `.bisis`, `x`, and others. Often executed via cron.
- **`History`**: Triggers the initial infection chain; likely a shell script used to start execution of `Update`. Minimal detection likely due to obfuscation.
- **`UpzBUBnv`**: Suspicious binary transferred via SCP. Score of 8/64 and unknown purpose, but tightly linked to malicious sequences and lateral movement.
- **`cache` / `.balu`**: Clear cryptomining binary. High detection rate (34/64). Delivered via `curl` from known malicious infrastructure.
- **`kuak`**: Second cryptomining component. Detected aggressively (31/64), indicating known malicious signature.
- **`diicot`**: Lower VT score (9/65) than `kuak` but still flagged. Tied to known Romanian Diicot threat group malware.
- **`dinpasiune.com`**: Used to serve payloads in both `./retea` and `./network` scripts. Flagged on VirusTotal with a 12/94 score.
- **`85.31.47.99`**: IP associated with payload retrieval. Involved in both `cache` and `.balu` delivery; VT score is 11/94.

**Note**: Some file functions were inferred from observed behavior and command usage rather than static analysis alone. All VirusTotal scores are as of the latest scan and may fluctuate as new detections emerge.
